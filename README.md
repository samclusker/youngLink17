# About Me

Hello 👋, I'm Sam and welcome to my Github. I'm a software engineer with a focus on DevOps tools and practices. I'm also a futurist, so predictably I'm a blockchain and crypto enthusiast having recently participated in some web3 hackathons - with more planned in the future!

## What I'm Working On 🧑🏻‍💻

I'm currently working on some certifications in the cloud and DevOps remit, lookng at Azure and Terraform certifications. Another thing on my radar currently is Encode Acadamy's Solidity bootcamps which I hope to join in the near future. 

ReactJS has been a focus of mine recently and I'm attending a ReactJS course in the coming weeks so I can figure out just how to stop prop drilling 👀

Some personal projects have stalled as COVID restrictions lifted, although I wish to get back to some sort of online writing - perhaps technical writing. Just not quite figured out my direction right now - you can view the initial beginnings on samclusker.com.

* Azure
