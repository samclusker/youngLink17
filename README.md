# About Me

Hello 👋, I'm Sam and welcome to my Github. I'm a software engineer with a focus on DevOps tools and practices. I'm also a futurist, so predictably I'm a blockchain and crypto enthusiast. 

## What I'm Working On 🧑🏻‍💻

Development in my spare time has often been non-existent as I'm a keen writer, however I'm currently participating in Encode Club's 'Hack Africa' event so I'm back in action! I'm developing a dApp with my friend @HarryMoy called Bondible. I'm also in the process of creating a Github Pages website to capture the journey and also some other thoughts.

As part of the Bondible build I'm learning React so I suppose I could migrate away from Jekyll in the future.

## Tech Stack 🔧

Here is a list of what tools I currently work with professionally and personally:

* Azure
* Terraform
* Ansible
* Azure DevOps Pipelines
* AWS
* React
* NodeJS
* Solidity
* Mongo

## Newsletter 🗞

I write a weekly newsletter focussing mainly on cryptocurrency, blockchain and futurist topics, however it's a process of refinement so I suspect it could change as the weeks go on. If you fancy following that refinement journey you can sign up here - https://newsletter.samclusker.com

## In Futurae Fidelis 🔮

I also write more informative/speculative pieces over on In Futurae Fidelis with a friend of mine @HarryMoy. The latin translation is roughly 'faithful in the future' because we're both super excited about the future and the changes it brings! We write about upcoming technologies and sometimes get a little whacky discussing the future of society and the impact technology will have on it. Have a gander - https://futuraefidelis.co.uk

## Future Talk 🗣

As well as writing about the future, Harry and myself also talk about it. The 'Future Talk' podcast is a great way for us to bounce ideas of one another and also get thinking more creatively about what the future might hold. You can listen on iTunes, Spotify, Google Podcasts and more. Perhaps you'd like to come on the show and have your say on the topic of that week! Get in touch.
